1. Get all "initial" filling type or "issued" permit status >>> every first issued permits
2. Renewed for how long?
3. Latest renewed.
4. Whether still active by year (stacked plot)

### Missing Data: Sources from DOB Permit Issurance & DOB NOW Building Application Permission
According to NYC Active Permit Map, there are currently more than 8,000 sidewalk shed in NYC. However, tracing from DOB Permit Issurance data (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Permit-Issuance/ipu4-2q9a/data_preview), there are only around 140 permits with expiration date after 2024.Wondering why this huge difference exists, I downloaded source data from NYC Active Permit Map and found that there are two sources, "BIS/ BIS SCA"(124 entries) and "DOB NOW"(8128 entries). This means that data from DOB Permit Issurance are likely to include only BIS source data. 

* 124 != 140 might be because Active Permit Map was downloaded on Jan 8 while DOB Permit Issurance was retrieved on Feb 5.

**Difference between DOB NOW & DOB**:
- Job Number: both unique identifier; DOB NOW starts with letter (B=Brooklyn, M=Manhattan, Q=Queens, S=Staten Island, X=Bronx), DOB starts with digit (1 = Manhattan, 2 = Bronx, 3 = Brooklyn, 4 = Queens, 5 = Staten Island)
- Geographical info: DOB has more complete geographical info: COUNCIL_DISTRICT, CENSUS_TRACT, NTA_NAME, ...
- Job Description: DOB NOW has a free fill-in text for detailed description
- Estimated Job Costs: DOB NOW has an column for estimated job cost

To get a whole picture of all past sidewalk shed permit (including those are no longer active), I merged DOB Permit Issurance data with DOB NOW Building Approved Permit (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-NOW-Build-Approved-Permits/rbx6-tga4/data_preview).

```{r}
D_sidewalk_and_active <- merge(D_sidewalk_permits, D_AP_2) %>%
  data.frame() %>%

D_sidewalk_and_active$parsed_expire[D_sidewalk_and_active$parsed_expire < D_sidewalk_and_active$active_expired_parsed] <- D_sidewalk_and_active$active_expired_parsed
```

```{r}
D_sidewalk_permits[D_sidewalk_permits$job__ == "104416464",]
```

#### In what year was the most sidewalk shed permits issued?

```{r}
D_sidewalk_permit_active_year <- D_sidewalk_permit_active %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  group_by(created_year) %>%
  summarize(
    SP_by_year = n(),
  )
```

**2015** has the most new sidewalk shed permits issued: 6662.
```{r}
D_sidewalk_permit_active_year[order(-D_sidewalk_permit_active_year$SP_by_year),]
```
```{r}
ggplot(D_sidewalk_permit_active_year, aes(x=created_year, y=SP_by_year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill=rgb(0.1,0.4,0.5,0.7) ) + 
  labs(
    title = "Number of new sidewalk shed permits issued by year (excluding renewal)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "# of sidewalk shed permits"
  )
```

**Peaking stage 1**: 2006 - 2014 (What happened to 2009?) more than 5,000 new sidewalk shed permits per year.

**Peaking stage 2**: 2015 - Today, more than 6,000 new sidewalk shed permits per year.

Hypothesis 1: Buildings age more quickly?

Local Law 10 was issued in 1980 and amended by Local Law 11 in 1998, the year of the very first data entry from this dataset. It requests "periodic inspection of the exterior walls and appurtenances of Buildings greater than six stories in height". Here, "periodic inspection" means at least once in every five years. If not considering about new buildings, we probably expect 5-year cycle of number of permits increases, which is not obvious in the graph below.

**How many of these are still active to-date?**
```{r}
unique(D_sidewalk_permits_2$active)
nrow(D_sidewalk_permits_2$active==TRUE)
vec_count(D_sidewalk_permits_2$active)
```
```{r}
head(sort(D_sidewalk_permits$parsed_date,decreasing=TRUE), n = 5)
```

```{r}
D_sidewalk_permit_active_year_2 <- D_sidewalk_permit_active %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  group_by(created_year) %>%
  summarize(
    SP_by_year = n(),
    active = active
  )

ggplot(D_sidewalk_permit_active_year_2, aes(x=created_year, y=SP_by_year, fill= active)) +
   geom_bar(position="stack", stat="identity") + 
  labs(
    title = "Number of sidewalk shed permits issued by year",
    x = "Year",
    y = "# of sidewalk shed permits"
  )
```
How many sidewalk shed were taken down each year?
```{r}
D_sidewalk_permit_expire_year <- D_sidewalk_permit_active %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  filter (
    expired_year < 2024 & expired_year > 1989
  ) %>%
  group_by(expired_year) %>%
  summarize(
    expired_by_year = n(),
  ) 
# %>%
#  mutate(
#    expired_perc_by_year = expired_by_year / total_by_year
#  )

D_sidewalk_permit_expire_year[order(-D_sidewalk_permit_expire_year$expired_by_year),]
```
6861 sidewalk shed (presumably) went down in 2023!

```{r}
ggplot(D_sidewalk_permit_expire_year, aes(x=expired_year, y=expired_by_year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill=rgb(0.7,0,0.2,0.7) ) + 
  labs(
    title = "Number of sidewalk shed permits expired by year (final expiration)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "# of expired sidewalk shed permits"
  )
```
```{r}
# join created and expired
D_sidewalk_active_expired <- fuzzy_left_join(D_sidewalk_permit_expire_year, D_sidewalk_permit_active_year, by=c("expired_year" = "created_year"), match_fun=list(`==`))

D_sidewalk_active_expired %>% ggplot(aes(x = expired_year)) +       # basic graphical object
  geom_line(aes(y=expired_by_year, colour="expired"),) +  # first layer
  geom_line(aes(y=SP_by_year, colour="issued"),) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c(
    'expired' = 'red',
    'issued' = 'blue')) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of sidewalk shed permits issued / expired by year (final expiration)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "# of sidewalk shed permits"
  )
  
#  matplot(expired_year, cbind(expired_by_year, SP_by_year), type = "l", lty = 1, 
#       col = c("red", "blue"), xlab = "Year", 
#        ylab = "# of Sidewalk Shed Permits", main = "Issued & Expired Sidewalk Shed Permits by Year") + legend("topleft", legend = c("Expired", "Issued"), 
#       col = c("red", "blue"), lty = 1)
```
### How about "Get Sheds Down"?

Finding 1: No outstanding increase in expired permits after July after "Get Sheds Down" was announced. 
```{r}
D_sidewalk_permit_active_2023_month <- D_sidewalk_permit_active %>%
  filter(expired_year == 2023) %>%
  mutate(expired_month = month(expired_date)) %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  group_by(expired_month) %>%
  summarize(
    expired_by_month = n(),
  )

ggplot(D_sidewalk_permit_active_2023_month, aes(x=expired_month, y=expired_by_month)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill=rgb(0.7,0,0.2,0.7) ) +
  labs (
    title = "# of Expired Sidewalk Sheds Permit in 2023",
    x = "Month",
    y = "# of Sidewalk Sheds"
  ) 
# + abline(lm(D_sidewalk_permit_active_2023_month), v=7.5, col="blue")
```
Permit Renewal: Is it harder to renew your permit?
Finding 2: Shorter duration requires more renewals today, meaning each renewal permits a shorter period of time to work compared to before.
```{r}
D_sidewalk_permits_renew_2023 <- D_sidewalk_permit_active %>%
  data_frame() %>%
  filter(
    is.na(expired_date) == FALSE,
    is.na(created_date) == FALSE,
    job__ != '',
    created_year >= 2014
    ) %>%
  mutate(
    date=as.Date(created_date),
    duration = difftime(expired_date, created_date, units="day"),
    dur_num = as.numeric(duration)
  )

# unique(D_sidewalk_permits_renew_2023$renewal_count)
ggplot(D_sidewalk_permits_renew_2023, aes(x=date, y=renewal_count, colour=dur_num)) +
  geom_point(
        size=0.7,
        alpha=0.5
        ) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of renewal Vs. duration",
    x = "Date",
    y = "# of renewal",
    color = "duration"
  )

# ggplotly(p)
```

```{r}
D_sidewalk_permits_renew_2023[D_sidewalk_permits_renew_2023$dur_num == 1,]
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
