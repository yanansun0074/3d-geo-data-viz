# Sidewalk Shed in NYC

This is the repo for "City of Non-Stop Sidewalk Sheds", as part of the project "3D Geospatial Data Visualization in journalism"

### There might be three things you want from this github repo:

1. If you're interested in the methodology of the article, go to the "Methodology" folder and follow "data_cleaning.qmd" for data cleaning --> "3D_Map_PyDeck.qmd" for 3D mapping.

2. If you would like to learn about PyDeck for 3D geospatial visualizaiton in journalism, check out "Tutorial" folder only.

3. "3D_Map_PyDeck_Template.ipynb" is a template for you to create your own 3D Map. I recommend trying it out after seeing the tutorial file.
