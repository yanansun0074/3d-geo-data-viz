# scaffolding

Download scaffolding_complaints.Rmd and open it with R / VS Code / ... whatever works for you

Make sure Active_Sheds.csv is in the same directory as the notebook.

The other data is imported through API endpoint of NYC Open Data, which sometimes take sooooo long to load. If it takes way too long, the alternative is to download them manually and import with read_csv()

Here's the other data:
- DOB Permit Issurance: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Permit-Issuance/ipu4-2q9a/data_preview
- DOB NOW Build Approved Permit: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-NOW-Build-Approved-Permits/rbx6-tga4/data_preview

Let me know if you have trouble running the notebook!
